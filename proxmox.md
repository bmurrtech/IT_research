# Installation
- Download the latest installer and burn it to a USB drive. Create a bootable drive using either Etcher or Rufus.
- After burning the bootable .iso to the drive, plug it into the desired endpoint you wish to convert to a ProxMox Hypervisor.
- Ensure that the device has a conenction to your local network so it can auto-poulate the IP settings.
- Take special note of the IP address you assign

#### Installation Issues
- If an install goes ary, you can always use the PrxoMox debug mode built into the bootable .iso installer.
- Try rebooting with the .iso installer plugged in, but this time select "Advance" and choose the "debug" option.
- This will boot up in a Linux Debian CLI mode that allows you access to powerful CLI commands (i.e. wipe the drives and try reinstalling ProxMox).
- The drives are listed in the `/dev` folder path. Type `cd /dev` then type `ls` to list the contents of the folder to get the names of the disks (ex. `/dev/nvme0n1`). Take note of this as you will need it for the next drive wipe command.
- To wipe a corrupted install, type `wipefs -a /dev/[drive_name] [path_to_second_drive_if_applicable]`. After that, `exit` and `reboot` the endpoint and try the install again.
- You can also access BusyBox in dev/debug mode to fix a ZFS error, see below for the error message:

##### Boot fails and goes into busybox
If booting fails with something like:

```
No pool imported. Manually import the root pool
at the command prompt and then exit.
Hint: try: zpool import -R /rpool -N rpool
```
- This is because zfs is invoked too soon (it has happen sometime when connecting a SSD for future ZIL configuration).
- To prevent it, boot into debug mode, run Busybox (type `busybox` and hit `ENTER`), then try __ONE__ of the following:
 - a) edit /etc/default/grub and add "rootdelay=10" at GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT (i.e. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="rootdelay=10 quiet") and then issue a # update-grub
 - b) edit /etc/default/zfs, set ZFS_INITRD_PRE_MOUNTROOT_SLEEP='4', and then issue a "update-initramfs -k 4.2.6-1-pve -u"

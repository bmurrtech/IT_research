# Sales Fundamentals

### Endpoint Technology Evolution
![AV_EDR_convergence](https://i.imgur.com/wF4eQwb.png)

The Two Anti-virus Worlds Converge:
- AV World:
  - McAfee, Cylance, Legacy AV
- EDR (endpoint detection and response):
  - FireEye, CarbonBlack, EDR

![s1_compare](https://i.imgur.com/uNmWq2V.png)

- Typically, the __industry landscape for AV and EDR today__ ranges from three different initiatives:
  - __AV +__ : 40% say they have an AV, but they want to improve it
  - __+ / EDR / +__ : 30% say they do _not_ have an EDR, but they want to add one/improve existing EDR.
  - __Converge__ : 30% say they want to merge AV and EDR into one. Convergance is expected to grow as AI-awareness increases.
  
- __Information to Gather__:
  - Determine where they are coming from and where they want to go.
  - Determine who are the stakeholders/decision-makers.
  - What is driving the initative? (i.e we are on McAffe, we want to improve)
  - What is their dominatn perspective?

![pain_forces](https://i.imgur.com/2hYcZmg.png)
  
 - __Forces Driving Change__
   - Growing Attack Surface: COVID-19 caused a massive transformation in the way in which people work. No longer are workers primarily confined to the traditional security boundaries of the corporate office. A distributed and primarily work-from-home workforce creates unique security challenges that need to be continually addressed. Along with the migration of workloads to the cloud,  a firm's security perimeter now extends much further into networks no longer solely under their control.
   - The growing impact of a security event: Security events have far-reaching implications and force difficult business decisions. For example, how does a firm deal with a ransomware attack initiated by a hostile government or terrorist-affiliated entity when legislation prevents the transfer of funds to these organizations? What is the risk to the business if sensitive/confidential information is shared as part of an extortion campaign by a threat actor?
   - Security Cost: There are always typical cost concerns and the pressure to maintain, if not decrease security costs. There is constant pressure from the CFO on the CISO to reduce/contain/constrain the security budget. The CISO is tasked with doing more with less either in terms of human resources or security tools. Therefore _the ability to consolidate tools, improve operational efficiency, and reduce time to resolution_ are all imperatives to the business.
   - Many Audits/Compliances: Your customers face an ever-increasing landscape of audits and compliance requirements. Your ability to improve a firm's ability to respond/pass audits and achieve regulatory compliance mandates can be highly beneficial in securing and maintaining strong and lasting business relationships. 

> Did you know? A new _ransomware attack will occur every 11 seconds_ this year, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The cost of these attacks is expected to reach $20 billion this year.  - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/30/why-ransomware-costs-businesses-much-more-than-money/?sh=77455a2b71c6)
> As of the fourth quarter of 2021, the __average length of interruption after ransomware__ attacks on businesses and organizations in the United States __was 20 days.__  - [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1275029/length-of-downtime-after-ransomware-attack/#:~:text=Length%20of%20impact%20after%20a%20ransomware%20attack%20Q1%202020%2D%20Q4%202021&text=As%20of%20the%20fourth%20quarter,quarter%20of%202021%2C%2022%20days.)

  

- __Common Pain-points__:
  - What are the common pain points potential customers experience and the forces driving change in the industry?
  - _Asking the right questions_ to discover some of these would be beneficial.
     - "How concerned are you about ransomware?"
     - "What is your current response processes look like?"
     - "How confident are you that you have security installed on a 100% of your endpoints?"
  - Security Technology is Too Disruptive: IT Security rides a fine line of strong protections and not being a burden/impediment to the business. Legacy AV agents are bloated and inefficient and therefore consume valuable system resources such as memory and computing - this makes them challenging for traditional desktops but especially challenging in virtual environments or DevOps. Linux agents that operate in the kernel are difficult to maintain during OS updates and cause friction for developers while potentially degrading security until the EPP/EDR agent is updated to match the updated OS. 
  - Challenges in Hiring and Training Security Experts: It is very challenging nowadays to hire competent security people, to train and onboard them. _SentinelOne provides the best and most sophisticated detection and protection mechanisms_ (as validated by MITRE Engenuity testing) while at the same time making the technology accessible to security practitioners of all levels of experience. SentinelOne up-levels the security analyst and reduces the time and experience required to identify and resolve threats.
  - Recover from an Attack: The challenges of recovering from an attack can align with a direct financial cost but there may be hidden costs: business interruption losses and downtime, legal expenses, fines, brand, and reputational damage are just to name a few. Over 140+ Incident Response firms across the globe deploy SentinelOne during their investigation and remediation activities. When cyber professionals want to eradicate all potential sources of compromise, they turn to SentinelOne.
  - Making the Right Data Available/Visible: Logs. More data = more cost. Data is almost always a security pain point - there is either too much or too little. Too much data can be difficult, and costly, to navigate. Too little data can create blind spots and hamper threat hunts and investigations. Many SIEM solutions get very expensive as more data is retained for longer periods of time. _SentinelOne XDR provides a cost-effective and highly performant platform for data collection, threat detection, and response. Therefore, customers no longer have to suffer from the high cost of increased data collection and retention or the inherent performance degradation that is associated with increased data collection._
  - Lack of Visibility: The old saying that "You can't protect what you don't know about" applies here. These unknown, unprotected, unpatched, and highly vulnerable systems provide a point of entry for attackers. Whether it is Shadow IT assets, assets acquired through M&A activity, or poor inventory management; organizations suffer from a lack of visibility into the devices on their network. _Once compromised, the attacker has the potential for lateral movement within the network to target higher-value assets. SentinelOne closes this visibility gap by identifying managed systems that do not have SentinelOne installed while providing a mechanism to auto-deploy the SentinelOne agent to these devices, In addition, SentinelOne can locate and profile unknown, IoT, or rogue devices enhancing visibility while delivering policies to mitigate lateral movement in the event of a compromise of these vulnerable systems._

- Always know what is on your network, with advanced ML device fingerprinting to inventory and categorize assets.
- Protect yourself from device-based threats with I-click isolation of suspicious devices.
- Efficiently plug gaps in your network attack surface with automated peer-to-peer agent deployment.

#### Ranger Questions to Ask
- Rollout Agent How do you know if you have completed your agent rollout? (for example, do you have 100% coverage across managed endpoints or are there any
deployment gaps?) . What is the current process of uncovering existing deployment gaps or adding new devices and achieving coverage of managed devices (for
example, after activity)? What is the current process to fix deployment gaps? Would a peer-to-peer agent installation process be beneficial in closing deployment
gaps?
- Full Visibility Do you know every IP-connected device on your network? (when was your last inventory taken?)
- IoT IoT devices have notoriously poor OS security and are rarely patched and therefore present an easy point of entry for attackers. do you currently inventory IoT devices on your network? Do you have a quick process to identify which IoT devices may be more susceptible to attack (for example, which IoT devices are
at risk of Ripple20 vulnerabilities)?

#### Ranger Top Differences
- Ranger is woven into our existing agent: zero new software agents, hardware, or network changes make getting started easy.
- Configurable ML device fingerprinting algorithms efficiently categorize connected devices by function, without spamming your network.
- Securely, efficiently, and automatically deploy agents to unsecured endpoints with configurable peer-to-peer job automation.

## Cloud Workload Detection and Reponse

- Are you deployed in both an on-prem data center AND a public cloud? Khich Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) do you use?
- What is your mix of Linux vs. Windows servers (roughly)? What flavor of containers are you using?


#### Cloud WDR Top Differences
- App Control Engine prevents unauthorized code from hijacking your Ws and containers.
- Imutable Resource-efficient one agent protects the Kubernetes worker node, all its pods, and ail their containers. Complete visibility into containers, without the
overhead of sidecars.
- No kernel panics because our Linux and Kubernetes agents operate entirely in user-space, there are no tainted kernels and no kernel panics. DevOps can update
their host OS at will without fear of agent conflict.

## Singularity Identity
The recent Attivo Networks acquisition expands the Singularity" XDR platform's visibility and actionability across identity security surfaces. Active Directory is a
prime target for cyber attacks as it provides authentication and authorization for critical enterprise resources. SentinelOne replaces the inadequate, complex, and
expensive approaches to AD security with a straightforward and modern identity security suite.

#### Buyer Doubts
- __Can SentinelOne support my business?__ There is always a concern when bringing in a new solution, is this solution going to break my environment? This potentially could lead to greater pain than I am trying to solve. We have many compelling stories for many types of customers, use cases, verticals, complex environment, etc. It is on you to be pro-actively demonstrating the different Services and Products we offer, Peer reviews, Customer stories and/or references to vouch for SentinelOne.
- __Does SentinelOne work better than the competition?__ The security teams and leaders can't afford to make a mistake, so when they are
comparing competitors, they are actually focused on the question: does it work better than the competition in MY environment? Ensure you understand the customer's environment and needs, because it will come down to who's technology they are going to understand better. Sales and SE alignment is crucial as it is on you to explain how SentinelOne's security architecture design works better , now AND in the future.
- __Does SentinelOne work in MY environment?__ This is the main reason we lead the mdiscussion towards a Proof of Concept (POC). There is no "cookie-cutter" - as much as we provide Best Practices to the POC and equip our partners with all the knowledge and tools they need to run a successful POC (Look for the SentinelOne Partner Pre- Sales Proficient course), we have to listen to our customers, what their requirements and needs are and ensure we are addressing them, showing how the SentinelOne solution helps solve their pain points and problems.
-  __Does the product work?__ Usually it is resolved by Market research and Peer company conversations and Third Party Validations. Our competitors might throw this FIJD at the prospect and it is our mission to prove that the product works, it's not buggy and the ease of use makes a great user experience. A demo and a Proof of Concept (POC) will also help resolve this doubt. _Pro Tip_: For Malware testing capabilities leverage the MITRE ATT&CK validation, which emulates real-life, live attacks.
-  __How long will this solution be viable?__ Will SentinelOne be here in a year? Especially with how the market is changing - what is SentinelOne's viability as a company. SentinelOne Inc. raised Sl.2 billion in one of the cybersecurity industry's largest initial public offerings., and we are growing strong.

### Endpoint Technology Evolution

![AV_EDR_convergence](https://i.imgur.com/wF4eQwb.png)

The Two Anti-virus Worlds Converge:
- AV World:
  - McAfee, Cylance, Legacy AV
- EDR (endpoint detection and response):
  - FireEye, CarbonBlack, EDR

![s1_compare](https://i.imgur.com/uNmWq2V.png)

![MITRE_ATT&KK_Results_Data](https://i.imgur.com/vIqzWxO.png)

- Typically, the __industry landscape for AV and EDR today__ ranges from three different initiatives:
  - __AV +__ : 40% say they have an AV, but they want to improve it
  - __+ / EDR / +__ : 30% say they do _not_ have an EDR, but they want to add one/improve existing EDR.
  - __Converge__ : 30% say they want to merge AV and EDR into one. Convergance is expected to grow as AI-awareness increases.

![xdr_handle_objections](https://i.imgur.com/UpuaKDt.png)

### How Is XDR Different From SIEM?
- When we talk about XDR, some people think that we are describing a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) tool in a different way. But XDR and SIEM are two different things.
- SIEM collects, aggregates, analyzes, and stores large volumes of log data from across the enterprise. SIEM started its journey with a very broad approach: collecting available log and event data from almost any source across the enterprise to be stored for several use cases. These included governance and compliance, rule-based pattern matching, heuristic/ behavioral threat detection like UEBA, and hunting across telemetry sources for IOCs or atomic indicators.
- SIEM tools, however, require a lot of fine-tuning and effort to implement. Security teams can also get overwhelmed by the sheer number of alerts that come from a SIEM, causing the SOC to ignore critical alerts. In addition, even though a SIEM captures data from dozens of sources and sensors, it is still a passive analytical tool that issues alerts.
- The XDR platform aims to solve the challenges of the SIEM tool for effective detection and response to targeted attacks and includes behavior analysis, threat intelligence, behavior profiling, and analytics.

### How Is XDR Different From SOAR?
- Security Orchestration & Automated Response (SOAR) platforms are used by mature security operations teams to construct and run multi-stage playbooks that automate actions across an API-connected ecosystem of security solutions. In contrast, XDR will enable ecosystem integrations via Marketplace and provide mechanisms to automate simple actions against 3rd-party security controls.
- SOAR is complex, costly, and requires a highly mature SOC to implement and maintain partner integrations and playbooks. XDR is meant to be ‘SOAR-lite’: a simple, intuitive, zero-code solution that provides actionability from the XDR platform to connected security tools.

### What Is MXDR?
- Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) extends MDR services across the enterprise to get a fully managed solution that includes security analytics and operations, advanced threat hunting, detection and rapid response across endpoint, network, and cloud environments.
- An MXDR service augments the customer’s XDR capabilities with MDR services for additional monitoring, investigations, threat hunting, and response capabilities.

### Why XDR Gaining Traction?
- XDR is the [all-in-one secuirty package](https://youtu.be/QikuJsgsgxk). XDR replaces siloed security and helps organizations address cybersecurity challenges from a unified standpoint. With a single pool of raw data comprising information from across the entire ecosystem, XDR allows faster, deeper, and more effective threat detection and response than EDR, collecting and collating data from a wider range of sources. 
- XDR provides more visibility and context into threats; incidents that would not otherwise have been addressed before will surface to a higher level of awareness, allowing security teams to remediate and reduce any further impact and minimize the scope of the attack.
- A typical ransomware attack traverses the network, lands in an email inbox, and then attacks the endpoint. Addressing security by looking at each of those independently puts organizations at a disadvantage. XDR integrates disparate security controls to provide automated or one-click response actions across the enterprise security estate such as disabling user access, forcing multi-factor authentication on suspected account compromise, blocking inbound domains and file hashes and more – all via custom rules written by the user or by logic built into the prescriptive response engine.
- This comprehensive visibility leads to several benefits, including:
  - Reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) by correlating across data sources.
  - Reducing Mean Time to Investigate (MTTI) by accelerating triage and reducing time to
investigate and scope.
  - Reducing Mean time to respond (MTTR) by enabling simple, fast, and relevant automation.
  - Improving visibility across the entire security estate.
- Moreover, thanks to AI and automation, XDR helps reduce the burden of manual work on security analysts. An XDR solution can proactively and rapidly detect sophisticated threats, increasing the security or SOC team’s productivity and returning a massive boost in ROI for the organization.

- __Reducing IT Friction__ Do you have a fully staffed SOC? Are your existing SOC personnel and resources sufficient to provide peace of mind? Many attacks and breaches occur during holidays and weekends when attackers know organizations are not fully staffed. Therefore, it might be useful to discuss the merits of a 24x7 - 365-day MDR service to augment their existing resources.
- __Optimizing Time To Value__ How quickly are you typically able to respond to an escalated security incident? Are you outsourcing incident response? Does your organization have an Incident Response retainer with a 3rd party firm? Does your cyber insurer have a specific contracted IR firm they utilize/mandate for a breach?
- __Integration__ How are you currently integrating threat hunting into your cybersecurity program? What does that process look like? Would your organization benefit from a managed threat hunting offering? How difficult is it for you to threat hunt using your existing toolset?

### Threat Services Top Differences

- __Rollout Agent__ How do you know if you have completed your agent rollout? (for example, do you have 100% coverage across managed endpoints or are there any
deployment gaps?) . What is the current process of uncovering existing deployment gaps or adding new devices and achieving coverage of managed devices (for
example, after activity)? What is the current process to fix deployment gaps? Would a peer-to-peer agent installation process be beneficial in closing deployment
gaps?
- __Full Visibility__ Do you know every IP-connected device on your network? (when was your last inventory taken?)
- __IoT__ IoT devices have notoriously poor OS security and are rarely patched and therefore present an easy point of entry for attackers. do you currently inventory IoT devices on your network? Do you have a quick process to identify which IoT devices may be more susceptible to attack (for example, which IoT devices are
at risk of Ripple20 vulnerabilities)?

### Ranger Top Differences
- Ranger is woven into our existing agent: zero new software agents, hardware, or network changes make getting started easy.
- Configurable ML device fingerprinting algorithms efficiently categorize connected devices by function, without spamming your network.

## Singularity Identity
[Identity Datasheet](https://assets.sentinelone.com/identity-security/singularity-identity-ds)
[Identity Sales Deck](https://partners.sentinelone.com/prm/English/s/assets?id=379423&q=identity)
[Hologram Datasheet](https://assets.sentinelone.com/identity-security/singularity-hologram-ds)
[Ranger AD Assessor Datasheet](https://assets.sentinelone.com/identity-security/ranger-active-directory-assessor)

[Attackers are very aware that Active Directory is the crown jewel of a business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC3zrKY7M_c), granting them the ability to _exfiltrate sensitive information, install backdoors, alter security policies, and more_.

The recent Attivo Networks acquisition expands the Singularity" XDR platform's visibility and actionability across identity security surfaces. Active Directory is a
prime target for cyber attacks as it provides authentication and authorization for critical enterprise resources. SentinelOne replaces the inadequate, complex, and
expensive approaches to AD security with a straightforward and modern identity security suite.

![s1_identity](https://imgur.com/NNFnKEd)

### Identity Value Prop
- __Singularity Identity__ protects Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD assets, including domain controllers and domain-joined endpoints in real-time.

real-time.
- __Singularity Hologram__ detects, misdirects, and isolates attackers that have established footholds in-network through indistinguishable decoys of production
OSes, applications, and more.

### Identity Questions to Ask
- How would you know if your Active Directory is under attack?
- Do you have visibility to exposure/vulnerabilities that an attacker would take advantage of in AD?
- Who is responsible for the hardening of your Active Directory data?
- How do you assess the risk posture of your organization from identity attacks targeting AD and Azure AD? When was the last time you audited your AD infrastructure?
Would you be interested in a solution that can provide automated and continuous auditing of AD?

### Identity Differences
- Continually assess your identity risk to check for vulnerabilities in real-time.
- Replaces the need for manual, costly and disruptive audits.
- Real time detection of active AD attacks.

## Singularity Mobile

### Singularity Storyline (STAR)

![s1_storyline](./media/s1_storyline.gif)

![Deep-dive of Storyline Dashboard](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/ieu9xi1yae)

__Storyline Active Response (STAR)__ allows customers to write Automated Policy, Detection and Response Actions. This enables your Security team to “teach” SentinelOne what to stop with extensible, automated XDR.
- Eliminate mundane tasks and noise
- Eliminate clicks, tab switching, and consoles
- Integrate multiple products and workflows

### What is Data Ingest?
- Data ingestion is the _process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database_. To ingest something is to take something in or absorb something.
- When buying XDR Ingestion, the customer starts pushing data into SentinelOne XDR Platform via one of several mechanisms - they can query their Data next to EDR.
- Data Ingest Use Cases:
  - __Integration with a Specific Vendor__ - When a user wants to integrate with a specific vendor in multiple ways and amongst other things wants to ingest Data so they can search it.
  - __Multiple Vendors and Products__ - When a user wants to bring all of their Data from their various products and query/hunt/retain it all together, to benefit from SentinelOne workflows.
  - __Data Lake/SIEM Cost__ - When a user can not afford long-term retention in their current Data Lake/SIEM platform. Also, many customers have to exclude certain data that they would like to collect/analyze/retain due to excessive cost. In addition, the performance of traditional SIEM platforms degrades as the volume of data increases.

### XDR Platform SKUs Details
- __Data Retention__ The platform _comes with a 14 days retention_ for all create/ingest Data.
- __Open XDR Data Ingest__ The platform _comes with the license to ingest_ and an initial amount of XDR Data.
- __STAR - Storyline Active Response__ The platform _comes with STAR_ which allows customers to write Automated Policy, Detection and Response Actions. _This enables the SOC team to "teach" SentinelOne what to stop with extensible, automated XDR_. The platform comes with the ability to _create 100 Rules_.

> All options above can be expandable at an additional cost.

## What is Multi Tenancy?
According to Wikipedia, a software multitenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. Systems designed in such manner are "shared". A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance.

### Benefits of Multi Tenancy
- __Scalability__ -  Whether you’re managing a handful of endpoints or thousands, scalability, agility and  stability will help you solve today AND tomorrow's challenges so you can growth your business confidently. 
- __Automation__ - We often spend countless hours on manual tasks that are prone to errors. Automation is the only way for organizations to accelerate their digital transformation by freeing IT and security teams of repetitive tasks so that they can focus on driving transformative projects. 
- __Efficency__ - Comprehensive ease of use of the platform helps drive processes and improves operational maturity.

> __SentinelOne Hierarchy__ is organized as follows: Global > Account > Site > Group

### Threat Hunting Capabilities 

- [__Deep Visibility__](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/ce4g2xvtsh), you get full access to _the who, what, when, where, and why of every situation_. This not only enables strong root cause analysis but gives you the in-depth insights necessary to best protect your organization. See [Deep Visibility knowledge base](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/sections/360006475094-Deep-Visibility) for more details.
  - This helps achieve:
    - high efficacy in detection of unknown, novel attacks
    - greatly reduced false positive rates (because many attack and reconnaissance techniques are actually part of the normal flow of applications and IT operations)
- [__Remote Script Orchestration (RSO)/Remote Ops__](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/ieu9xi1yae) lets you run scripts to collect data and respond to events on endpoints remotely. You can collect forensic artifacts, execute complex scripts and commands, install and uninstall IR tools and more, on hundreds of endpoints simultaneously. See [RSO knowledge database](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010484822-Remote-Script-Orchestration-RSO).
- [__Full Remote Shell__](https://youtu.be/1JfjfxFT0LY) gives your security team a rapid way to investigate attacks, collect forensic data, and remediate breaches no matter where the compromised endpoints are located, eliminating uncertainty and greatly reducing any downtime that results from an attack. See [Full Remote Shell database](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/sections/360005935333-SentinelOne-Remote-Shell) for more details.

### Pain and Forces Driving Change

![pain_forces](https://i.imgur.com/2hYcZmg.png)

- Typical pain points are important to understand as there are many pain points we hear from our prospects. Awareness of some common pain points can help you ask probing questions to uncover specific pain points for your prospects. 
- __Current Endpoint Solution is leaving companies too exposed__: This pain is applicable in almost every single engagement. _Legacy Signature-based security_ technologies (such as Symantec, Sophos, Trend, etc.) are _leaving companies vulnerable to threats such as ransomware_.
- __Information to Gather__:
  - Determine where they are coming from and where they want to go.
  - Determine who are the stakeholders/decision-makers.
  - What is driving the initative? (i.e we are on McAffe, we want to improve)
  - What is their dominatn perspective?

### Pain Points
 - __Respondiong to Threats or Being Proactive__ Our prospects understand how to respond to threats. But _they don't understand what it means to be proactive_ or more importantly, they don't know there is a _better way to respond to threats_.
    - __S1 Solution__: _SentinelOne Rollback capability_ gets prospects excited, but they won't come asking for SentinelOne because of it.
    - __Questions__: _What is your current response processes look like? If your customer gets hit with ransomware on an endpoint thereby creating a security event: What does that look like? How do they notify the business? What are their mitigation actions?_
  - __Lack of Visibilty/Too Complex Secuirty Architecture__: The old saying that _"You can't protect what you don't know about"_ applies here. Whether it is Shadow IT assets, assets acquired through M&A activity, or poor inventory management; organizations suffer from a lack of visibility into the devices on their network. _These __unknown__, unprotected, unpatched, and __highly vulnerable__ systems provide a point of entry for attackers_. Once compromised, the attacker has the potential for lateral movement within the network to target higher-value assets.
    - __S1 Solution__: _SentinelOne closes this visibility gap by identifying managed systems that do not have SentinelOne installed while providing a mechanism to auto-deploy the SentinelOne agent to these devices, In addition, SentinelOne can locate and profile unknown, IoT, or rogue devices enhancing visibility while delivering policies to mitigate lateral movement in the event of a compromise of these vulnerable systems._
    - __Questions__: How confident are you that you have security installed on a 100% of your endpoints?
  - __Security Technology is Too Disruptive__:  Legacy AV agents are bloated and inefficient and therefore consume valuable system resources such as memory and computing - this makes them challenging for traditional desktops but especially challenging in virtual environments or DevOps.
    - __S1 Solution__: _SentinelOne solves this problem by providing efficient and __lightweight agents__ while supporting the nuances of various OS types (Windows, macOS, Linux)._
  - __Challenges Hiring and Training Secuirty Experts__: It is very challenging nowadays to hire competent security people, to train and onboard them. In addition, retaining top-level talent is extremely difficult. Legacy EDR vendors (like CarbonBlack or Crowdstrike) require a very sophisticated skill set to operate and utilize to their full potential.
    - __S1 Solution__: _SentinelOne up-levels the security analyst and reduces the time and experience required to identify and resolve threats, thanks to the intuitive Storylines and S1 dashboard._
  - __Rising Cost of Maintaining Secure Environment__: Many organizations rely on a Defense-in-Depth approach to security which can result in an ever-increasing set of security tools (and cost) to manage.
    - __S1 Solution__:_SentinelOne's XDR strategy enhances the value of these various tools through centralized reporting, telemetry collection, detection, and response across an ecosystem of security tools._
  - __Recover from an Attack__: The challenges of recovering from an attack can align with a direct financial cost but there may be hidden costs: business interruption losses and downtime, legal expenses, fines, brand, and reputational damage are just to name a few.
    - __S1 Solution__: _Over 140+ Incident Response firms across the globe deploy SentinelOne during their investigation and remediation activities. When cyber professionals want to eradicate all potential sources of compromise, they turn to SentinelOne._ __Entry Point__: Learning more about how _reliant or dependent they think they might be on backup systems_ could help you better position SentinelOne's solution.
  - __Making the Right Data Available/Visible__: Data is almost always a security pain point - there is either too much or too little. Many SIEM solutions get very expensive as more data is retained for longer periods of time. In addition, performance degrades as more data is collected and retained. _SentinelOne XDR provides a cost-effective and highly performant platform for data collection, threat detection, and response.
    - __S1 Solution__: Therefore, customers no longer have to suffer from the high cost of increased data collection and retention or the inherent performance degradation that is associated with increased data collection._

> Did you know? A new _ransomware attack will occur every 11 seconds_ this year, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The cost of these attacks is expected to reach $20 billion this year.  - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/30/why-ransomware-costs-businesses-much-more-than-money/?sh=77455a2b71c6)

### Factors Driving Change
- __Everchanging Threat Landscape__: An ever-changing threat landscape has boards and CEOs worried about the potential impact on their business coming to their security operations.
- __Growing Surface Attack__: COVID-19 caused a massive transformation in the way in which people work. No longer are workers primarily confined to the traditional security boundaries of the corporate office. A distributed and primarily work-from-home workforce creates unique security challenges that need to be continually addressed. Along with the migration of workloads to the cloud,  a firm's security perimeter now extends much further into networks no longer solely under their control. 
- __Growing Impact of a Security Event or Incident__: Security events have far-reaching implications and force difficult business decisions. For example, how does a firm deal with a ransomware attack initiated by a hostile government or terrorist-affiliated entity when legislation prevents the transfer of funds to these organizations? What is the risk to the business if sensitive/confidential information is shared as part of an extortion campaign by a threat actor? 
- __Security Cost__: There are always typical cost concerns and the pressure to maintain, if not decrease security costs. There is constant pressure from the CFO on the CISO to reduce/contain/constrain the security budget. The CISO is tasked with doing more with less either in terms of human resources or security tools. Therefore the ability to consolidate tools, improve operational efficiency, and reduce time to resolution are all imperatives to the business.
- __Cyber Insurance and Regulations__: _EDR is becoming a business requirement, not a technical luxury_. With a deeper understanding of the security controls that directly impact breach prevention, insurers are requiring certain core technologies, such as EDR, Multi-Factor Authenticator (MFA), Disaster Recovery and more. _An organization’s security profile drives its cyber insurance policy premium and a lack of the required technology could lead to increased premiums or even denied coverage._
- __Many Audits__: Your customers face an ever-increasing landscape of audits and compliance requirements. Your ability to improve a firm's ability to respond/pass audits and achieve regulatory compliance mandates can be highly beneficial in securing and maintaining strong and lasting business relationships.

> As of the fourth quarter of 2021, the __average length of interruption after ransomware__ attacks on businesses and organizations in the United States __was 20 days.__  - [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1275029/length-of-downtime-after-ransomware-attack/#:~:text=Length%20of%20impact%20after%20a%20ransomware%20attack%20Q1%202020%2D%20Q4%202021&text=As%20of%20the%20fourth%20quarter,quarter%20of%202021%2C%2022%20days.)

## The Security Architecture Diagram

![security_framework](https://i.imgur.com/4JqM2RP.png)

- The Security Architecture Diagram is a framework of the building blocks of a customer's environment. In this lesson, we will walk you through how things fit together and the goal is to get some insight into the environment.
- The purpose of this Security Architecture Diagram is to start a conversation to drive the discovery of the customer's initiatives, goals, and decision processes.
- __Identity__- Who manages Active Directory? The Keys protect the data - what is protecting the keys?
- __Prevent__ - Prevention. Stopping threats before they have any effects. Realm of AV/NGAV technology or harden AD configuration. 
- __Detect, Investigate and Respond__ - Detection, Investigation and Respond. The domain of the SOC and threat hunting teams - giving the security team an active tool to stop the bleeding. Realm of EDT, ITDR, and EDR.
- __Resolve__ - Getting back to normal operations, get back as fast as possible so we can get back to business. This may involve multiple teams which is a huge effort and time-consuming.

### Know Your Audience

It is critical that you know your audience. People in different roles have different motivations, different levels of technical depth, and different pain points. Below is a typical org structure in the different organizations. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/TJ6uxGz.png)

## Buyer Doubts

![buyer_doubts](https://i.imgur.com/q1Yp8QX.png)

- __Can SentinelOne support my business?__ There is always a concern when bringing in a new solution, is this solution going to break my environment? This potentially could lead to greater pain than I am trying to solve. We have many compelling stories for many types of customers, use cases, verticals, complex environment, etc. It is on you to be pro-actively demonstrating the different Services and Products we offer, Peer reviews, Customer stories and/or references to vouch for SentinelOne.
- __Does SentinelOne work better than the competition?__ The security teams and leaders can't afford to make a mistake, so when they are
comparing competitors, they are actually focused on the question: does it work better than the competition in MY environment? Ensure you understand the customer's environment and needs, because it will come down to who's technology they are going to understand better. Sales and SE alignment is crucial as it is on you to explain how SentinelOne's security architecture design works better , now AND in the future.
- __Does SentinelOne work in MY environment?__ This is the main reason we lead the mdiscussion towards a Proof of Concept (POC). There is no "cookie-cutter" - as much as we provide Best Practices to the POC and equip our partners with all the knowledge and tools they need to run a successful POC (Look for the SentinelOne Partner Pre- Sales Proficient course), we have to listen to our customers, what their requirements and needs are and ensure we are addressing them, showing how the SentinelOne solution helps solve their pain points and problems.
-  __Does the product work?__ Usually it is resolved by Market research and Peer company conversations and Third Party Validations. Our competitors might throw this FIJD at the prospect and it is our mission to prove that the product works, it's not buggy and the ease of use makes a great user experience. A demo and a Proof of Concept (POC) will also help resolve this doubt. _Pro Tip_: For Malware testing capabilities leverage the MITRE ATT&CK validation, which emulates real-life, live attacks.
-  __How long will this solution be viable?__ Will SentinelOne be here in a year? Especially with how the market is changing - what is SentinelOne's viability as a company. SentinelOne Inc. raised Sl.2 billion in one of the cybersecurity industry's largest initial public offerings., and we are growing strong.

### Pre-Sales Demo Flow
This 4 simple steps Demo Flow will help you make your demo count.

#### Consensus
Step 1: Arriving at Consensus - This first critical moment of agreement comes before you even begin a live demo. __Identify what would be the desired outcomes and plan accordingly.__
- Before the meeting, spend time with the customer who is championing you in their company. 
- Learn about their stakeholders and ask what challenges those individuals are facing that might impact the use of your product. As you introduce the SentinelOne XDR story and introduce the platform, you’ll use that information to help drive the team towards agreeable outcomes.
- __A few simple questions that will help__
  - I understand that your primary objective/challenge(s) is/are _____. _Is that still your main goal(s)_?
  - I’m here to demonstrate how the SentinelOne platform can improve your ______. Is that still a key metric for you?
  - The reason we’re meeting today is to _______. Is that correct?

#### Climatic Moments
Step 2: __Create an "aha!" moment.__ Deliver Climatic Moments Presenting can come with obstacles: “managing attention spans, dueling distractions, running against the clock etc.”  It’s very important to establish, at the beginning of the session, that you are talking about the same things.
- Grab the audience attention by sharing a few statements like “we are here to solve problems 1, 2 and 3 – and that is what we are going to show you in the demonstration today…”
- Think like a Magician - Start product demos with a theoretical bang! It would be very helpful to share some success stories, like a real user testimonial, to build trust and confidence.
  - SentinelOne Protects [TGI Fridays](https://assets.sentinelone.com/casestudy/sentinel-one-tgif-cs-1) from Headquarters to the Table - Strong, easy to deploy, and simple to manage.
  - Managing endpoints across the enterprise with limited time and staff? No problem! Watch why [FIM Bank](https://assets.sentinelone.com/casestudy/sentinel-one-fim-ban) chose SentinelOne's Vigilance MDR to augment their SOC. Global financial institutions trust the SentinelOne platform to save time through ActiveEDR and unparalleled protection.
 - Learn why [Aston Martin designates SentinelOne as its official cybersecurity partner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjfsHzlmm4E), and what made SentinelOne Singularity Complete and Vigilance MDR more compelling than other solutions on the market—including Aston Martin's incumbent legacy AV provider.
- __Few simple suggestions that will help__
  - Pay special attention to any comments from prospects that begin with phrases like: “I need…”/“I don’t know…”/“The problem is….”/“I’ve noticed…”/“If we could….”.
  - Give tailored examples of real product uses and impact that illustrate how other users just like them have navigated some problem or benefited from your solution. They’ll move from passive listeners to proactive and will remember you.
  - Include stats relevant to the stakeholders you’re meeting, like implementation time, availability, or accuracy.
  - Activate the customer's [Reticular Activating System (RAS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/reticular-activating-system) - What information makes it to your brain and what you ignore or filter out.

#### Contentment
Step 3: Feeling Contentment - __Stakeholders must feel contentment, excitement, and confidence at the thought of implementing the solution.__ The goal of is simply to get buyers to the point of having enough comfort with you that they’re willing to commit to further conversations. This is the acceptance that SentinelOne is a potential solution to their problem.
- _Curiosity_ means your audience wants to learn more. Encourage discussion by providing answers that illustrate value, give more detail to how the SentinelOne Solution would benefit them, and introduce deeper functionality. 
- _Concern_ isn’t an automatic red flag but implies a level of suspicion! This means they believe the SentinelOne Solution could potentially solve important issues.  Demonstrate expertise by addressing the customer problem areas that come up during session discussions. 
- _Confusion_ could be indicating lack of understanding or feelings of uncertainty around the SentinelOne Solution. Actively address by speaking in clear, friendly terms that build confidence in the relationship, simplify the benefits of the SentinelOne solution. Provide examples and success stories that resonate with the perceived complications of the prospect.

#### Commitment
Step 4: Making a Commitment - No matter how the SentinelOne demo ended - we are moving forward. The ultimate goal of a great Pre-Sales demo is to __achieve “commitment”, that includes much more than just a signed contract.__
- A customer “Commitment” can result in:
  - Follow-up Technical / Architectural session
  - Next meeting with additional Corp Stakeholders
  - Meeting with Sales around Procurement / Discuss Pricing
  - Beginning business contracting / negotiations

> __How did my computer infected with a macro virus?__  You can activate it __just by performing normal everyday tasks, like editing a Word document or opening your emails__. Example: __1999 Melissa Virus__ A now-classic example of a macro virus is the Melissa Virus from 1999. After a user opened an email containing a document infected with the virus, the virus would send itself to the first 50 addresses in the user’s contact list. Melissa had grave implications for company and web servers that carried the large volumes of emails being created. _It successfully crippled hundreds of networks_, __including__ those of __Microsoft and the United States Marine Corp.__ IBM Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y.

# Troubleshooting
### Agent Communication Troubleshooting
[Agent Communication Troubleshooting](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/au4j7lwe7v)
- Troubleshoot and fix offline Agent and communication issues.
- Check network connectivity to the Management Console from a Windows endpoint.
- Check and adjust the SentinelOne Agent proxy server configuration.
- Let SentinelOne co-exist with other security vendors.

#### How to Troubleshoot
Agents can lose connectivity with the Management Console for multiple reasons: installation corruption, proxy settings, firewall restrictions, DNS issues, and more.
1. Ping to Console.sentinelone.net and verify that the address resolves.
2. Test Telnet to Console.sentinelone.net in port 443.
3. Try to connect to the Management using the _local internet browser_ to verify the certificate (3rd-party browsers will not work; i.e. Google Chrome, Firefox)
4. [Check if there are any other anti-virus applications installed](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050677434).

> Best Practice: Uninstall third-party anti-virus software before you install SentinelOne. Other security software often prevents Agent installation or affects its performance.

6. Check if there is a proxy server configuration. > Start (right-click) > Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy > Check if Proxy settings are accurate by using the Sentinel CTL Commands (see below)
7. If invalid certificate: > Download and install the certificate from certiticate authority 

![s1_ctl](https://i.imgur.com/ADv4e4R.png)

```
cd "C:\Program Files\SentinelOne\Sentinel Agent..." 
SentinelCtl.exe config | find "proxy"
SentinelCtl.exe config server.proxy "http://10.0.0.4:8080" -k "[passphrase]"
```

> To get the passphrase, use the S1 Management Console > click on the endpoint > Actions (button) > Search for "passphrase" > Show Passphrase > Copy the phrase > Paste it after the `-k "[passphrase]"

### Endpoint Performance Troubleshooting
- Use the Agent Activity Analyzer on Windows to identify performance issues.
- Run the Agent Activity Analyzer through the Management Console and SentinelCommand Line Tools (SentinelCTL).
  - Sentinels (sidebar) > Click Agent > Click Actions > Troubleshooting >  Search for Fetch Logs > Check "Agent Logs" > Click Fetch Logs (button).
  - There is also a CTL [CLI log fetch option](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055283454). See below. 
- Create Interoperability and Performance Focus path exclusions

- Collecting logs to submit to support for additional support and troubleshooting.
- Setting an exclusion to resolve a performance issue and testing.

### Interoperability Troubleshooting
Exclusions are important for app functionality on endpoints.
[Interoperability Video Tutorial](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/53tyvsjhh8)
[Tool - Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
- To exclude certain apps/processes, navigate to:

```
> S1 Management Console > Sentinels > Exclusions > New Exclusions (button) > Create Exclusiong/Add from Exclusions Catalog > Set the OS (Windows) > Select/Enter path to exclusion > Set exculsion type (i.e. file) > Set the "Exclusions Mode" to either _Interoperability_ or _Interoperability - Extended_ > Click Excluded from Current Scope (button)
```

> Note: Pre-defined interoperability exclusions are available from the catalog.

- Temporarily disable the SentinelOne Agent to troubleshoot interoperability issues.
- Use Sysinternals Process Explorer to examine Process details.
- Use the Knowledge Base and Exclusions Catalog to check for known interoperability cases.
- Create an Interoperability path exclusion to prevent SentinelOne DLL injection.
- Sometimes it can be necessary to disable the agent to prove or disprove an interoperability issue. This video walks through the following:
  - Disabling the agent so that you can prove/disprove an issue with an application. For example, if you disable the agent, but an issue still exists, the problem most likely doesn't lie with SentinelOne and the application.
  - Adding exclusions to prevent and resolve interoperability issues.
  - Collecting logs for SentinelOne support.

### Agent Installation or Upgrade Troubleshooting
[Agent Installation/Upgrade Troubleshooting Video Tutorial](https://sentinelone-education.wistia.com/medias/j2r0jyz6fw)
- Fetch Agent and endpoint logs through the Management Console.
- Use the Offline Log Collector to collect Agent logs on the endpoint.
- Troubleshoot using the Windows Agent install and upgrade logs.
- Collect data before you submit a support ticket.

```
cd "C:\Program Files\SentinelOne\Sentinel Agent..." 
cd Tools
LogCollector.exe WorkingDirectory=C:\Temp
```
- Now check the `temp` directory for any S1 install logs.

```
cd %temp%
```

- If the clean install is from MSI, and the MSI fails before handing off to the Sentinellnstaller, the log filename is `MSI* . LOG` __This is the file we want to submit with our support ticket.__ However, there are a few additional troubleshooting steps before opening a ticket we can take:
  - Scroll to the bottom of the log, hit `CTRL + F` to search up for "failed".
  - Look through the log for any clues for what caused the failed installation (i.e. "Missing siteKey, aborting", or "a connection with the server could not be established"). 

- Try checking the `Mitigation policy` status. If the status reads `Mitigation policy: none` there is a communication issue. Check the status bu running the following cmdlet:

```
cd "C:\Program Files\SentinelOne\Sentinel Agent..." 
SentinelCtl.exe status
# to generate a text file of the output
SentinelCtl.exe status > C:\Temp\s1status.txt
SentinelCtl.exe config > C:\Temp\s1config.txt
```

- If it was a successful install, you will find logs in the following path: `C:\ProgramData\Sentinel\UserCrashDumps`. There should be logs here that automatically generated after a successful installation.

- __EDR - Endpoint Detection and Response__: EDR provides an organization with the ability to monitor endpoints for suspicious behavior and record every single activity and event. It then correlates information to provide critical context to detect advanced threats and finally runs automated response activity such as isolating an infected endpoint from the network in near real-time. EDR data is also a critical component of forensic investigations which is why many cyber insurers are now mandating EDR capabilities in the underwriting process. Therefore, EDR is now not only a technology initiative but also a business risk imperative for most customers.
- __XDR - Extended detection and response__: XDR is the evolution of EDR, Endpoint Detection, and Response. XDR automatically collects and correlates data across multiple security vectors, facilitating faster threat detection so that security analysts can respond quickly before the scope of the threat broadens.
- __MXDR - Managed Extended Detection and Response__: MXDR extends MDR services across the enterprise to get a fully managed solution that includes security analytics and operations, advanced threat hunting, detection and rapid response across endpoint, network, and cloud environments.
- __SASE - A Secure Access Service Edge__: SASE is a technology used to deliver wide area network (WAN) and security controls as a cloud computing service directly to the source of connection (user, device, Internet of things (IoT) device, or edge computing location) rather than a data center. It uses cloud and edge computing technologies to reduce the latency that results from backhauling all WAN traffic over long distances to one or a few corporate data centers, due to the increased movement off-premises of dispersed users and their applications. This also helps organizations support dispersed users and their devices with digital transformation and application modernization initiatives.
- __IAM - Identity Access Management__: Identity management, also known as identity and access management, is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users have the appropriate access to technology resources. 
- __NAT - Network traffic analysis__: NTA is a method of monitoring network availability and activity to identify anomalies, including security and operational issues.
- __IR - Incident response__: IR is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT incident, computer incident or security incident. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.
- __CIRT - Cyber Incident Response Team__: This group is responsible for responding to security breaches, viruses and other potentially catastrophic incidents in enterprises that face significant security risks. In addition to technical specialists capable of dealing with specific threats, it should include experts who can guide enterprise executives on appropriate communication in the wake of such incidents. The CIRT team typically operates in conjunction with other enterprise groups, such as site security, public relations and disaster recovery teams.
- __DFIR - Digital forensics and incident response__: DFIR services are advisory services that help clients identify the extent of, and deal with, events and requirements such as security and IT incident investigations, forensic response and triage, and security breaches.
- __SIEM - Security information and event management__: SIEM technology supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (both near real-time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources. The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disparate sources, and operational capabilities (such as incident management, dashboards and reporting). SIEM tools are very passive tools and do not provide any response actions. This essentially differentiates SIEM from XDR.
- __SOAR - Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response__: SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies — where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power — help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format.
- __Workflow__: A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information.
